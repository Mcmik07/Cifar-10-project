# Cifar-10-project
This repository contains a project focused on handwritten digit recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a well-known benchmark dataset in computer vision, consisting of 60,000 color images of size 32×32 pixels, divided into 10 classes (such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more). Although CIFAR-10 is not originally designed for digit recognition, the project adapts it to explore classification techniques and model performance on small, low-resolution images.

The goal of the project is to build and train a model capable of correctly identifying handwritten digits using simple, clear, and well-structured code. The workflow includes creating a neural network model with PyTorch, downloading and preparing the CIFAR-10 dataset, defining the loss function and optimizer, and training the network. The project also emphasizes best practices in deep learning, such as data normalization, batching, and monitoring training progress.

Finally, the repository provides plots to visualize the evolution of the loss and accuracy throughout the training process, which are crucial for evaluating the model’s learning behavior and overall performance.
